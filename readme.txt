The CAD files and engineering drawings below describe the MR compatible macaque stereotax frame. The authors hereby make the designs available for the public in an effort to support the ethical considerations referred to as the “three Rs” - Replacement, Reduction and Refinement. The stereotax is free to use, re-use, and modify, however, commercial use is not allowed. If these designs have aided in the completion of another study or publication, please include the proper citations. Comments can be addressed to:David J. Schaeffer, Ph.D.dschaeff@pitt.edu
